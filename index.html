<p>You will see the types of questions you can include in your videos. A multiple choice example, a select one, text answer, numeric answer and a discursive answer.</p>
<p>In all types you could select the time to launch the question, stoping video. You can answer the question as many times you want, receiving the feedback it was correct or not. To continue the video there is a button called Continue, available even if you dont know the answer. When you click Continue, usually the video will show the solution. And after answer correctly, you could optionally show a button called Jump Solution (jump to a future point in the video), that could be used to jump the solution explanation.</p>
